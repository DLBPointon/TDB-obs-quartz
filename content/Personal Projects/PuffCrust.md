My [[Vault]]/ShortCrust version 2. Many of the services from Vault will be ported over, this will of course be somewhat of a headache as the containers will have to be updated to the respective x86

## Potential Hardware
| Hardware | Description |
|---|---|
| Ryzen 3/5 G processor | Will have to buy |
| 16Gb Crucial Ballistix | DDR4 3200Mhz - Spares |
| B450 Aurous ATX motherboard | Spare from toubleshooting GPU fault, need to check wether working / ITX would be nicer |
| Corsair 750 Gold PSU | Something smaller would be nicer from an efficiency POV |
| Case | unknown yet, would like something with a few hot swap cages though |
| External HDD | 4Tb |
| External HDD \*2/3 | 10 Tb |
