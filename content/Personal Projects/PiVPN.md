## Set Up
1 - Write a sd card with Pi OS 64-bit using Raspberry Pi Imager (I used v1.7.3).
	- Write your settings using the cog before you click write. This will allow you to set your admin user and pass as well as your wifi creds if your not using WLAN.

2 - Plug the sd card in and power up.

3 - Connect to the Pi and follow the [Docs](https://docs.pivpn.io/install/) to set up PiVPN.
