# Better metadata parsing - Jellyfin-youtube

Repo::
Description:: A simple python script to parse filenames or a info.json to improve file organisation of videos downloaded for educational use.

## What is it for?

The pre-existing youtube metadata plugin doesn't meet my requirements or is possibly broken (according to recent issues), I think it should be possible to a simple python script to parse a .info.json file and/or the filename to generate better outcome.
