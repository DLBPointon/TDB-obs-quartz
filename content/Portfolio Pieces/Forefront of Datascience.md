Over the past three years as I have become comfortable with Sanger systems I have started to try and push my knowldedge further. I have done this by working on by:

- [[TMDB]] - Updating personal projects into vue.js from HTML and JavaScript. 

- [[TreeVal]] - Bring amoungst the first teams at Sanger to move towards a Nextflow + NF-core standards + ToLIT standards.

- [[TreeVal]] - Developing a new pipeline and frontend combination based on newer technology to replace the current solution as well as ship to other collaborative groups.

- Slack Bots - Although sounding simple, these bots interact with both the Slack API as well as the JIRA API in order to pull data meeting certain specifications.
