Description:: How I have continued learning and pushing my skills to improve organisation processes as well as my own personal projects, this involved keeping up with new technologies as well as learning technologies which many not necessarily be part of my day-to-day work.

Over the past three years as I have become comfortable with Sanger systems I have started to try and push my knowldedge further. I have done this by working on by:

- [[TMDB]] - Updating personal projects into vue.js from HTML and JavaScript. 

- [[TreeVal - md team and tracking time]] 
	- Bring amoungst the first teams at Sanger to move towards a Nextflow + NF-core standards + ToLIT standards.
	- Developing a new pipeline and frontend combination based on newer technology to replace the current solution as well as ship to other collaborative groups.

- [[Slack Bots]] - A simple group of bots which interact with both the Slack API as well as the JIRA API in order to pull data meeting certain specifications.

- In my personal time I also enjoy learning new technologies which I have incorporated into my home network. Details about this can be found here: [[Personal Projects/Personal Project Homepage]].
