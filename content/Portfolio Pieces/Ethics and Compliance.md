Description:: What is the Nagoya Protocol and how it effects DTOL work.

### The Project
DTOL does not just work with data obtained from Britain and the British Isles, the project is also partnered with the Vetebrate Genomes Project (VGP) a North America led project which will sometimes rely on Sanger for the sequencing, assembly and curation of certain rare organisms.

As this partnership involves the international distribution of a genetic resource (e.g. biological material including plant, animal, microbial or any manterial in which contains the functional units of heredity. This excludes human genetic material.) in order to extract a genomic resource , an important protocol comes into play: The Nagoya Protocol.

##### What is Nagoya?
The Nagoya Protocol is a framework developed in the Convention on Biological Diversity and is used to implement a specific objective:

> The fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilisation of genetic resources.
> - GovUK (2022)

This objective makes it essential that anyone who extracts data from a genetic resource makes said data availble to those who supplied the original material. In the case of Sanger it is therefore required that the data extracted from the genetic resources is shared with the VGP, and in the international arena the protocol was originally drafted in order to stop the exploitation of Indigenous peoples (their land and waters) by companies (forcing them to at least share the profits of discovery).

In order for work to begin on a genetic resource

##### The affect of Nagoya on Research
The Nagoya Protocol is undoubtably a step in the right direction for open science, collaboration and ensuring that indigenous peoples and their land are not abused by those profiting off of their genetic resourses (also known as biopiracy, [one such case](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03374-x) in 2019, forces a company to share its profits with the Indigenous San and Khoi people of Southern Africa).

The beurocratic nature of such protocols does however slow reseach, each genetic resource must be well documented and approved by the relavent government (the onus is on the recipient of the sample to perform due diligence and prove that the sample has been collected properly and follows the Nagoya Protocol). The amount of time required to fullfill these requirements can leave samples, for an extended period of time, on ice (sometimes literally) which may degrade any genetic material.

This can decrease the quality of research performed unless sample collection and shipping can be planned in advance, something which cannot be done in the case of rare protected organisms. In these cases, the sameple may have to be prepared and stored in sub-par conditions which may degrade any genetic material that is present, depending on the method used. Ultimately this can result in genetic material that is degraded and lessens the impact of research in there respective field, conservation genomics or genetic surviellance, such as in malaria and mosquito tracking.

The entirety of the Nagoya protocol may also change in the coming years as there is a growing push to include digital data, see table 1. How this would effect online repositories such as NCBI and ensembl, which share digital genomic data internationally, is unclear and woud hopefully come under a blanket Nagoya certificate such like copyright notices in a GitHub repo.

Table 1: A list of articles that have made arguments for or against expanding the Nagoya protocols to include digital data.

The arguments in the cites papers of Table 1 centre around one major theme, this is that modern science already applies it self to open science where databases freely provide genomic data to all and regulation of this will hamper the very fabric of open science. Essentially the beurecratic machine would hamper novel research and force companies to pay a share of the profits to the country in which the organism of interest originated from. 

Those that are for this measure however are typically based in the Global South where their genetic resources have been abused by non-indigenous people, e.g. corporations, and they have not received any compensation for what is their genetic resource.

These are quite standard arguments, however, the implications get more interesting the deeper it is researched. Digital Sequence Information (DSI), the digital genomic data, is not propperly defined and makes no mention of the nuances of genetic data or even of the distribution of species. Many species do not reside within the borders of an individual country. In these cases, is the financial renumberation divided between these countries? What about genes which are closely related and shared between a number of species? 

This is a complex topic and whilst its aim of essentially ending biopiracy is a noble cause, the current proposals are too prehibitive to the open science databases that have been created over the past near 30 years. I beleive there is case for penalising corporations which abuse the lands genetic resources without renumeration for the local peoples but the current proposals put the onus on the databases to essentially track and control the distribution of the data.

The potential of including DSI into the Nagoya Protocol has already hindered the work currently on-going at Sanger. Noted in the article, Global accessibility of DSI in easy-to-access databases seen in table 1, partnership programs in Gabon and Ethiopia have stalled due to uncertainties in the current Nagoya protocol framework. This program supplied mosquito samples for MalariaGEN which we assemble and curate, which can also impact our own workflows.

A key case-study relates to the project I am primarily assigned to, The Dawrin Tree of Life Project. This project is a sub-project of the multi-billion dollar Earth Biogenome Project, which aims to sequence the genomes of all 1.5 million known species of animals, plants, protozoa and fungi on Earth. As of January 2023, there are sub-projects across the majority of Earth, each relying on the principles of open science to send and retreive data for the goal of improving our knowledge in conservation genomics and understanding our ecosystems. These noble goals can only be fullfilled if the data is able to flow easily and rapidly through existing open science databases without hinerance from a third party such as a DSI enhanced Nagoya Protocol. This hinderance has the potential to irrepearably damage conservation effects and reponses the emerging threats to biodiversity.
