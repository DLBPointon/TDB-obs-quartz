Description:: How have I attempted to improve my attitude in a diverse working group?

### The Project
Whilst working at Sanger I have worked in a heavily diverse team, with members from across the globe, however it can be easy to simply not think about the difficult situations in that some have faced to enter the Data Science field. As someone who has a specific learning dissability as well as coming from a low-socioeconomic background, I feel I have a first hand experience of this dissmissal of my struggles. However as a, somewhat, young, white, cis-gendered male, it is easy to simply not see the struggles experiences by others.

For this reason as well as to be more of an advocate for diversity I have joined the Wellcome Trust's Socio-Economic Equity Staff Network (SEESAW). This group aims to increase the awareness of how differing life experiences and unconcious biases have effected any one persons entry into there respective role. For instance, in the first session the organisers reveiled data on Sanger recruitment practices which historically showed that it is a white middle class male institution. Although this has changed dramatically in the past decade, there are still hangovers of that original homogenous mix. For example, the simple weekly pub lunch is quite common and disadvantages those from low socioeconomic backgrounds which simply cannot spend the £40-50 that a Cambridge pub lunch costs.

In the second session, the sociologist Sam Friedman gave a talk on his book 'The Class Ceiling' which analyses the role of class in the 'elite' workplaces of Britain and how those who get the top jobs typically from upper-middle-class origins.

This book is an interesting read and highlights issues the 'double disadvantage' encountered by woman and racial ethnic minorities from working-class backgrounds.

>“We have uncovered clear evidence – both quantitative and qualitative – that women and racial ethnic minorities from working-class backgrounds face a distinct ‘double disadvantage’ in Britain’s elite occupations, and that this inequality is often multiplicative rather than simply additive. In this way, we might see the barriers facing these groups as often more accurately constituting a denser, and less easily shattered, ‘concrete ceiling’”.

A similar issue can even be found as closely to home as this Bioinformatics Degree in which the majority of those on the course are Cambridge local, unconciously reinforcing the idea that the best people for the job are local people from an area considered wealthy. Unfortunately this is an issue that is compounded by the fact that only those coming from such an area can afford to live in the area, whilst others may struggle whilst also facing the pressures of work-place social events.

These are issues which can only be fixed by intentional action, actively visiting schools (with diverse groups of speakers) to teach about what Data Science entails. Teaching that anyone and everyone can have a place in Data Science if they, and only themselves, want it. Sanger is making headway in this by visiting schools (even if only Cambridge local school as of present) and specific recruitments programs (recently announing a paid internship program for Black people wanting to enter Data Science, as it is an under represented ethnicity).

### Future Plans
To continue my engagement in SEESAW and push for a Sanger specific working group to open a dialouge on these issues.
